# Sparse Functional Partial Least Squares Regression with a Locally Sparse Slope Function

This folder consists of the coding for the simulation studies and applications in the manuscript.


1. functions.R: the R functions used to generate data for the simulation studies and implement the proposed SFPLS method, the FPLS method, the FPLS_R method, the FPCR method and the SLoS method.

2. sim_firstKcomp.R: the R code for the simulation study for the proposed SFPLS method, the FPLS method, and the FPCR method using the first K terms of their bases for each of K = 1,â€¦,5. 

3. sim_SFPLS.R: the R code for the simulation study for the proposed SFPLS method.


4. sim_FPLS.R: the R code for the simulation study for the FPLS method.


5. sim_FPLS_R.R: the R code for the simulation study for the FPLS_R method.


6. sim_FPCR.R: the R code for the simulation study for the FPCR method.


7. sim_SLoS.R: the R code for the simulation study for the SLoS method.


8. OSB.csv: the OSB furnish data.


9. Truck.csv: the particulate matter emissions data.


10. OSB_analysis.R: the R code for analyzing the OSB furnish data by using the proposed SFPLS method and the FPLS method. 


11. truck_analysis.R: the R code for analyzing the particulate matter emissions data by using the proposed SFPLS method and the FPLS method.
